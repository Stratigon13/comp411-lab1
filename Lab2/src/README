1. Outlines of the organization of my program:
   We wrote three functions callByValue(), callByName(), and callByNeed() in our interpreter functions. callByValue()
function is suppose to pass in all the parameters by the value any directly evaluated them. callByName function is suppose
to pass in all the parameters by its reference and calculate the results.



2. The testing Process our team has used to confirm the correctness of our program:
   We wrote test cases for each method in order to test the correctness of our
program. In addition, we ran each provided test case and checked that our
interpreter failed only on bad inputs.
