Applying Slip Day: 1 Day

README for Comp 411, Project 02.

	1. We wrote one of the three required functions callByValue(),
callByName(), and callByNeed().  We used an ASTVisitor to return a JamVal from
the AST which the parser provided.  We found difficulty in implementing some
of the most crucial aspects of the interpreter, namely map, apply, and let. We
tried several techniques for interpreting these expressions, but ultimately
did not find a satisfactory solution.  As I consider this the main goal of
the project, I hope we can still gain some partial work from the code we
wrote.  The reason we did not complete callByName() or callByNeed() is because
these functions differ from callByValue in the application of closures and the
implementation of the three AST types I mentioned earlier.
   
	2. We tested several simple operations but unfortunately due to time
constraints were largely unsuccessful in completing the task.  On the next
project we will manage our time more wisely.
