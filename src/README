README for Comp 411, Project 01.

1. Outlines of the organization of my program:
   We decided to use the procedural way instead of the object-oriented way to construct the parse functions for our
program. We have constructed 6 methods in total, parse(), parseExp(), parseFactor(), parseTerm(), parseIDList(), and
parseExpList. In our parse() method, we mainly called the parseExp() Method to parse the incoming string since most input
string will come as a expression. And the parse() method will be the main function that we start to test in our testing
program, since it is the only public method available from outside of the Parser Class.


2. The testing Process our team has used to confirm the correctness of our program:
   We will construct a test case for each individual method in order to test their correctness. So we will have
testParseExp(), testParseTerm(), testParesFactor(), testParesExpList(), and testParseIDList(). And, in addition we will
run through each provided test case that is given by the instructor in order to make sure the correctness of our program.
For the bad input, the program should ideally output the corresponding error case, which should be tested my our test
cases in order to cover every edge cases.
