README for Comp 411, Project 01.

1. Outlines of the organization of my program:
   We decided to adhere to a more procedural paradigm as opposed to a more object-oriented approach to construct the parse functions.
in our program. We have written five parse related methods, parse(), parseExp(), parseFactor(), parseTerm(), and parseArgs().
In our parse() method, we mainly called the parseExp() Method to parse the incoming string since most input
string will come as a expression. And the parse() method will be the main function that we start to test in our testing
program, since it is the only public method available from outside of the Parser Class. However we will try to cover every
test case as possible.


2. The testing Process our team has used to confirm the correctness of our program:
   We will construct a test case for each individual method in order to test their correctness. So we will have to
test the parsing condition in term of Exp, Term, Factor, ExpList, and IDList in term of unique single unit test case.
And, in addition we will run through each provided test case that is given by the instructor in order to make sure the
correctness of our program. For the bad input, the program should ideally output the corresponding error case, such as
ParseExceptions, which should in turn be tested by my our test cases in order to cover every edge case.
